Francesco Paolo Lovergine <francesco@debian.org> has been the maintainer for Debian after 2006
and contributed with some patches to the upstream code later and the whole support for init/systemd.

Starting from 2023, he also revamped the code base to keep it updated and relevant.

Autodir has been written taking ideas from orginal autofs package. As such
there might be some code directly taken from autofs package.
