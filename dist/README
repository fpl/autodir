The dist/ directory contain contributed stuff useful for distributions.

That includes systemd unit files and an init sysv script taken 
from Debian which can be adopted by other distributions.
The Debian package and its derivatives already use systemd to
startup autodir and its modules (and used to run it via init
script until release 11).

While it is not mandatory to use such systems to run autodir
it is generally considered a best practice.
